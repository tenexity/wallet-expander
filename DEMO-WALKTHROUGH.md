## Suggested Ask Anything Questions

Use these questions during the demo to showcase the AI's capabilities. Each one is designed to return rich, specific results based on the current seed data.

### Portfolio-Level Questions (Scope: Portfolio)

1. **"Which accounts have the biggest revenue gaps and should be prioritized for enrollment?"**
   - Expected result: Highlights Midwest Pipe & Supply (score 87, 29% penetration, $162K revenue), Chicago Comfort Systems (score 86, 31% penetration), Carolina Climate Control (score 86, 34% penetration), and Premier Plumbing NJ (score 85, 28% penetration). All are unenrolled with high opportunity scores.

2. **"What's the risk situation with our enrolled accounts and what should we do about it?"**
   - Expected result: Identifies Palmetto Heating & Air (at-risk, Ferguson competitor quote, $10.7K Controls gap) and Coastal Mechanical (at-risk, 90 days with no growth, last order 47 days ago). Provides specific action recommendations.

3. **"How is Mike Thornton's territory performing compared to the other reps?"**
   - Expected result: Breaks down Mike Thornton's 9 accounts in Midwest/Great Lakes vs. Sarah Chen's 5 in Northeast/Mid-Atlantic vs. James Rivera's 6 in Southeast/Florida. Compares revenue, penetration, and enrollment rates.

4. **"Which accounts haven't ordered in over 30 days?"**
   - Expected result: Lists accounts with stale order history, flagging potential churn risks. Highlights Coastal Mechanical (47 days since last order) and any others with aging order dates.

5. **"Show me the total dollar opportunity across all unenrolled accounts."**
   - Expected result: Sums up the gap dollars across the 9 unenrolled accounts (Midwest Pipe, Chicago Comfort, Carolina Climate, Premier Plumbing, Atlantic Plumbing, Ohio Valley, Detroit Climate, Lake Shore, Indiana Plumbing). Should total well over $200K in addressable opportunity.

### Account-Level Questions (Scope: Account — select a specific account first)

6. **"What categories are we losing share in and how should I approach the buyer?"** *(Select: Midwest Pipe & Supply)*
   - Expected result: Details the PVF gap ($27.5K, 86.8%), Water Heaters ($25.9K, 76.2%), and smaller gaps. References the active Eastside Mixed-Use project as a conversation anchor.

7. **"Draft a strategy to win back the Controls category from Ferguson."** *(Select: Palmetto Heating & Air)*
   - Expected result: Builds a competitive counter-strategy referencing the $10.7K Controls gap, the Ferguson quote detection, and the Palmetto Gardens Condo project as leverage.
